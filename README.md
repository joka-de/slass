## General
This script will greatly ease the installation and management of three Arma3 servers including mods from the Steam workshop.</br></br>This is not a one-click-get-a-server script. Its usage is simple, but do yourself a favor and read this manual BEFORE you begin. Really. Basic knowledge of the linux command line usage is assumed.

## The Master-Branch is WIP, use the stable-branch
